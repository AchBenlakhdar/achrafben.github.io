<p align="justify">
Developed an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) by leveraging Deep Learning models with an overall accuracy
exceeding 96%. Implemented functionalities enabling traffic sign recognition, pedestrian detection, vehicle identification as well as distance calculations between the camera and detected objects. Conducted a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of R-CNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLO models,
providing a detailed performance comparison. Finally, I have successfully deployed the models on an FPGA board through the FPGA Vision Remote Lab, utilizing Nvidia CUDA for GPU acceleration to achieve optimal performance.
