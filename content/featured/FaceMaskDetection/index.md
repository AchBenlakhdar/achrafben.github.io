Collaborated with a cross-functional team, in my first ever internship as a data scientist, to build ML and DL models to predict Royal Moroccan Football Federation players' atheltic performance from biometric data, achieving an overall 94% accuracy rate. Acknowledged for impactful contributions within the data science team, I was appointed by the Managing Director as the project manager. In this role, I led interns, organized technical review meetings, and produced concise progress reports for senior leadership.
