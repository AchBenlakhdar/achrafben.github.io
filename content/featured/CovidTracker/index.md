<p align="justify">
Designed and co-developed a car rental SaaS platform from the ground up using React and Node.js, employing a REST
protocol architecture. The server-side business logic, made with Express, seamlessly interacts with the user interface built on React, ensuring a user-friendly experience for customers. Emphasizing security, we implemented robust APIs for sensitive user data retrieval and updates, incorporating secure authentication and authorization mechanisms through Passport, JWT, and Google OAuth 2.0 API. Throughout the development process, we embraced the Scrum methodology, fostering an Agile environment to ensure the project's success.
