Hello! I'm Achraf Benlakhdar and I'm currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong passion for Software Development and a commitment to achieving excellence through data-driven outcomes. My internship experiences have honed my ability to work in a diverse and multicultiral environment, communicate effectively and apply software engineering skills to various scenarios.

These diverse experiences weren't just milestones; they were learning opportunities that sharpened my technical skills. Whether diving into the fast-paced world of startups, streamlining processes in a mid-sized company, or making impactful contributions to projects at the World Bank, each experience has refined my professional skill set
